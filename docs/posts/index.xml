      <description>Next to our little Parson Russel terrier Toni, buying e-bikes was the best investment we made last year. Since we purchased them in February, right before the great corona run on the bike-retailers, we could use the full spring until fall for tours at home as well as the lovely and diverse Rhine and Moselle area.
However, since we had a journey of about forty kilometres to the last destinations, it was energy- and time-consuming to get two e-bikes in my 2016 Mercedes A-Class hatchback every time.</description>
