Hi, my name is Jens. Since 2012 I am employed as technical consultant and developer in Kronberg/Taunus. My main task is the architecture and implementation of complex, often cross-technology connections to the ERP *Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central*. In my spare time I like to ride E-MTB, hit the gym from time to time and play around with self-hosting of various open source tools. 

This space is my brain dump - a place where I write down my ideas, findings, and experiences. Whether I'm configuring servers, hitting the trails, or navigating the slopes, you'll find a mix of tech insights and outdoor escapades. Occasionally, I'll review products I like, providing insights and recommendations.
