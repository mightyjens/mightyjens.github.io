Hi, my name is Jens. Since 2012 I am employed as technical consultant and developer in Kronberg/Taunus. My main task is the architecture and implementation of complex, often cross-technology connections to the ERP *Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central*. In my spare time I like to ride E-MTB, hit the gym from time to time and play around with self-hosting of various open source tools. I will use this blog as some kind of a braindump of my ideas and findings. But you might find a couple of reviews or product tests as well.
