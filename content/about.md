Hi, my name is Jens. Since 2012 I am employed as technical consultant and developer at Comsol Unternehmenslösungen AG in Kronberg/Taunus. My main task is the architecture and implementation of complex, often cross-technology connections to the ERP Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. 

My professional career is one of the main objectives of this blog. Here I would like to share ideas, thoughts, and solutions around technology topics such as Microsoft Business Central 365, Python, C# and Node.JS. But there might additionally appear some other topics of my interest, like product/app reviews or even travel-logs.

In terms of content, this blog will probably be filled more with the things of daily nav-working-life. This might be insights and learnings from the earliest NAV Classic versions way to the most recent Business Central release. So the latest technological achievements of Microsoft may show up with significant delays 😀
