Hi, my name is Jens. Since 2012 I am employed as technical consultant and developer at Comsol Unternehmenslösungen AG in Kronberg/Taunus. My main task is the architecture and implementation of complex, often cross-technology connections to the ERP *Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central*. 

I have another [blog](https://www.j3ns.de) on which my professional career is one of the main objectives. Over there I share ideas, thoughts, and solutions around technology topics such as *Microsoft Business Central 365*, *Python*, *C#* and *Node.JS*. Here on my personal blog its more about topics of my interest, like selfhosting, product/app reviews or even travel-logs.
