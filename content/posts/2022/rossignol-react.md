This is a small review of my recently acquired ski, the *Rossignol React R8 HP Basalt*. When we were in Fiberbrunn for a week in early January, I was annoyed after a few days that I only had my relatively wide, not very maneuverable and heavy all-mountain skis with me. And of course, as always, there was no fresh snow in sight for the *Atomic Vantage* 90 to play to its strengths.

And let’s face it. Isn’t it like this in 90% of cases? You have no fresh snow all the week, but torture yourself with your “all-round” skis. So I relatively quickly got the urge to rent an explicit piste ski again. And after a little study of the last World Ski Test, me and the boys got stuck with the *Rossignol React R8*, the winning ski of 21/22. No sooner said than done, the next day I and some of my buddies rented it from the nearest sports store. Right the first turns have put a smile on my face. The ski leads wonderfully easy into the curves and is fantastically energy-saving. No comparison to the rumble on the wide all-mountain ski. It’s a blast both riding short brisk turns or long and wide curves and has enough stability for faster carving adventures.

## Verdict – The Rossignol REACT R8
For every ambitious skier I can highly recommend this combination. Get a decent piste ski with which you will have fun most of the time and thus also save a lot of energy! And for those handful of days when it really powders, keep your all-mountain in the back of your hand.

For me, the *Rossignol REACT R8* is currently the perfect ski. It is certainly not a high-end device and the market definitively holds some other weapons ready. But it drives fantastically easy and clean, is very energy-saving and also quite reasonable priced! I have purchased it at the right moment for under € 400.

My verdict: Buy it!
